//Make the pop up here to ask for the % productivity

//Make the distraction button here too along with the count logic 
//(dont save each distraction with timestamp this is too much rn)

//Efficiency rating logic here too? (expected vs actual)

//Calculate expected by considering a non-linear model where the more distractions
//causes a greater effect, i could use exponential?

//functions: handleProductivityRating, handleDistractions, handleEfficiencyCalculation

//add a new row to my session table to save the actual productivity, the amount of distractions
// the calculated efficiency


export function handleDistractions() {

}

export function handleEfficiencyCalculation(actualProductivity) {

    //between expected and actual

    //this function will return efficiency
    //this function needs to pass actualProductivity as a parameter
